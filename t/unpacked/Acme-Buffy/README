NAME
    Acme::Buffy - An encoding scheme for Buffy the Vampire Slayer fans

SYNOPSIS
      use Acme::Buffy;

      print "Hello world";

DESCRIPTION

    The first time you run a program under `use Acme::Buffy', the
    module removes most of the unsightly characters from your source
    file. The code continues to work exactly as it did before, but now
    it looks like this:

      use Acme::Buffy;
      BUffY bUFFY BUffY bUFFY bUfFy buffy BUFfy     buFFY BufFy     BufFY   bUFfy BuFFY buffy       bufFy bUffy bUffY BuFfy BuffY   bUFfy BUfFY BUFFy       Buffy bUffY     
      BuFFY BUFFy   BufFy BUFfy BUfFY buFfy BuffY   BuFfy   BUfFY bUffy     buFFy   BUffy   bUffy 

DIAGNOSTICS
    `Can't buffy '%s''
        Acme::Buffy could not access the source file to modify it.

    `Can't rebuffy '%s''
        Acme::Buffy could not access the source file to execute it.
