NAME
    CPAN::IndexPod - Index the POD from an upacked CPAN

SYNOPSIS
      my $i = CPAN::IndexPod->new;
      $i->unpacked("/unpacked/cpan/); # use CPAN::Unpack
      $i->plucene("/plucene/index);   # must be absolute path
      $i->index;

      # Then search with Plucene / Plucene::Simple or:
      my @files = $i->search("vampire");

DESCRIPTION
    The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) is a very useful
    collection of Perl code. It has a whole lot of module distributions.
    CPAN::Unpack unpacks CPAN distributions. This module will analyse the
    unpacked CPAN, index the Pod it contains, and allow you to search it.

    Right now it allows simplistic searching of NAME, SYNOPSIS and
    DESCRIPTION sections and returns a list of filenames.
